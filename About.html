    <h1> My Story </h1>
        <p1> When I was 10 years old, I got into manga (japanese comic book) called Naruto. I was so into the series that I would watch it everytime it is on, especially new episodes of the anime every saturday. There are 72 volumes in the entire series and I currently own 59 volumes. One day, I was reading one of the volumes and I was not only reading the pages but also paying close attention to the art. And then I thought "This art is really good, I want to try that." And so that's when my desire and passion for drawing comics began. </p1>
